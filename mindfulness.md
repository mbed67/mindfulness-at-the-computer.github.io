## What is mindfulness?

> "Mindfulness means being awake. It means knowing what you are doing" - John Kabat-zinn

Mindfulness is moment by moment, understanding what is going on inside and outside of ourselves. Mindfulness is a core human capability, one which helps to be fully present in the moment, aware of our surroundings, of what we are doing, as well as to help us not become overwhelmed by the many things that can be going on around us, and in our lives.


### Why is mindfulness important?

It's all too easy to lose ourselves, get preoccupied with work and not be fully aware of the present moment; mindfulness can help us to better enjoy the world around us, organise our thoughts and become more aware of the present moment. One of the best things about it, is that anyone can benefit from mindfulness, it draws on universal human qualities.

It is scientifically proven that over time, that mindfulness helps to improve happiness, wellbeing, as well as help to prevent depression, anxiety and stress.


### How is mindfulness at the computer different?

MATC is different in that we give you rest reminders, with suggestions on what you can do in that break time. Not only that, but our interface allows for a level of customising to make the experience perfect for you!
